# What is the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE)?
Google's Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) is a tool that converts a string of words into 512 dimensional vectors. These vectors capture the semantic meaning of the sequence of words in a sentence and therefore can be used as inputs for other downstream NLP tasks like classification, semantic similarity measurement etc.

# But wait...don't get too excited just yet

While USE is a fantastic tool and one maybe tempted to use it straight out of the bos, it is critical to know the underlying architecture of the model and most importantly, what kind of data it was trained on.
