Hi! Thanks for dropping by. I'm a final semester graduate student of Data Science at Columbia University.
Currently, I am a Data Scientist intern at IBM in New York. I'm actively looking for full-time Data Scientist opportunities starting February 2019. This a collection of some ML and Deep Learning blogs I'd like to share.
